# Binary Search Trees

Binary search trees are one of the fundamental data structures you learn about when you pick up a data structures text book.
I picked this for my presentation because binary search tree are a great structure to visualise and the implementation is possible using basics such as `IF/ELSE` and `WHILE`.

Before you get started on the exercises my favourite demo of the algorithm is [here](http://btechsmartclass.com/DS/U5_T1.html).
